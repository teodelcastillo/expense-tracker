## Description:
This GitHub repository contains an Expense Tracker application built using React, TypeScript, and Bootstrap. The purpose of this app is to allow users to track their expenses efficiently. As of now, the application operates solely on the client side and is not yet connected to a server.

### Functionality:

Expense Description: Users should input the title or description of their expense.
Amount: Users should enter the cost or amount of the expense.
Category: Users should select a category for the expense from a dropdown menu containing four predefined categories.
Once the user fills in these details, they can submit the form, and the expense will be added to a table displaying all recorded expenses.

### The app also provides the following features:

Filtering: Users can filter expenses by category, making it easy to view expenses within specific categories.

Total Amount: The app calculates and displays the total amount spent by the user on all expenses.

Deletion: Users can remove individual expenses from the list using a delete button.

Error handler: The submit button will not be clickable if there are errors, also error messages will appear to the user.

Please note that the app is currently a client-side implementation, meaning all data is stored locally and will not persist if the page is refreshed. Future development may include server integration to provide data persistence and synchronization across different devices.

Feel free to explore, contribute, or use this Expense Tracker app to manage your spending efficiently!# expense-tracker
